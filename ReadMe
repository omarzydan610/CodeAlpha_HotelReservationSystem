# CodeAlpha_HotelReservationSystem

Task 3 in my CodeAlpha JavaProgramming intership at codeAlpha.

Task is to build a hotel reservation system where users can view available rooms, make reservations, and view booking details.

Including features like room categorization and payment processing.

I handeled all errors of wrong input by printing error massege.

I add delay after operations to make it more realistic.

I also include ANSI escape codes to print colored text in terminal to make it more colorful & easy to deal with.
